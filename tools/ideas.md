This is just some notes to report ideas I had before not remembering it.

It doesn't mean that I will make them happen :)

## The clue analyzer
You take a picture of an item with the Arduboy, and it will print on screen some infos. Like which animal (including dinosaurs) does it belongs.

## The story teller
This would need a lot of bitmap pictures. You just press the A button, and it gives you a random image. Or maybe a list image, and you have to tell a story inspired by them.

## Meteo
A simple screen to check meteo

## Spaceship / Helicopter cockpit
Maybe too hard !
